        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>Boston University's system for viewing Terrier Card account balances and purchasing points is difficult to use and navigate to and is limited to a desktop view website only.</p>
        <p>I wanted to design an iOS application that would serve as a one-stop portal for students to view account balances, purchase new points, and develop bugeting skills.</p>

        <h2>Define</h2>
        <h3>The Idea</h3>
        <p>My roommate and I were doing laundry in our on-campus apartment. While paying for a dry cycle, her balance was too low and the transaction was declined. She struggled to navigate BU's student link through this flow. She assumed the option to add value to her account would be under the "Money Matters" section, however, she had to go back and forth before finding it within "Food and Drink", all while having to continuously zoom in on her phone.</p>
        <p>I wanted to streamline this process for students, taking into account what details of their account would be relevant, providing options for customization for students of all years, and making the interface as simple and intuitive as possible.</p>
        <h2>Ideate</h2>
        <h3>Wireframes</h3>
        <p>Having established our technology stack, I wireframed our web application, starting with our Most Viable Product (MVP). Turning to flows that users are familiar with, we wanted to emulate Tinder's focus of one profile at a time to help users with choice paralysis. We also wanted a very simplified version of our end product and settled on a random happy hour generator for the city of New York, based on our market research. In order to meet our deadlines for the launch of our MVP, features such as the date selector were not included in our MVP.</p>
        <h3>Mockup and Style Guide</h3>
        <p>During the wireframe hand-off process, the product side of our team had difficulty with naming conventions and making our code as clear and concise as could be. To solve this issue, I led a meeting with all members of our team to establish a common vocabulary in naming UI components on our site, as well as event trackers to analyze our user's behaviours. By building a common vocabulary, we were able to work more efficiently and could all partake in conversations regarding our website.</p>
        <p>I also created a style and branding guide to assist the developers with the development of our site. Prior to the launch of our MVP, and subsequent update releases, I did a front-end style pass through the website to ensure consistancy across all devices.</p>
        <h2>Iterate</h2> 
        <h3>Ad Strategy</h3>
        <p>After our MVP went live, we launched a series of Facebook advertisements in order to drive traffic to our website. We were instructed to use Facebook and Instagram ads as our only sources of paid traffic, with a budget of $7500 for 10 weeks. Working with the analysts, we designed various advertisements and A/B tests in order to improve our link conversions and the CPC of our ads. After running A/B tests, we found that the best ads featured images of women, had minimal text, and ran on Facebook</p>
        <h3>User Testing</h3>
        <p>Prior to wireframing and designing the next feature, I conducted user testing with a sample ot 7 participants both in and out of our target demographic. Since our data reflected that most of our users were accessing our website on a mobile device, I tested it with both Android and iOS devices. Our most notable takeaways included confusion around our Yelp integration, the copy on the homepage, and the user flow past Hey Bartender.</p>
        <h3>Next Iteration</h3>
        <p>When we asked users "After you found a special you liked on our site, what would you do next?", they responded by going to Yelp to view the rating, reviews, and look at their website. In order to improve our time on site KPI and to improve the user experience, our next utilized the Yelp API to show users the restaurant or bar's rating, the number of reviews on Yelp, telephone number, and a link to the website. While we initially designed for information such as parking, dress code, and ambiance, we had to reassess based on time constrainsts and API data restrictions.</p> 
        <h2>Current State</h2>
        <p>At the end of the 10 week internship, Hey Bartender was in over 120 cities across the US and haf 10,000 visitors. </p>
        <h3>Final KPIs</h3>

        <h2>Next Steps</h2>
        <p>This project is being taken over by a team at Cogo Labs, thus changes to Hey Bartender's style and functionality may be changed. I initially designed what I hoped Hey Bartender could one day become, an interactive map where users can explore areas near them.</p>
        <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
        <h3>Compliance</h3>
        <p>Especially since we were working with APIs, reaching out to users online, and scraping data, I learned a lot about compliance in regards to technology in order to make sure that we were within good standing. By making compliance a priority from the beginning, we were able to prevent unexpected pivots during the design and development stages. </p>
        <h3>The Development Cycle</h3>
        <p>While designers were not obligated to participate in the development of the project, I wanted to participate in the front-end. By learning from full time designers and engineers at Cogo Labs, I was able to learn React and Redux, as well as some back-end skills during my time there. I also had first hand experience on the hand-off process and learned ways to make the process more efficient and easier for the engineers.</p>
        <h3>Data and Design</h3>
        <p>The most important lesson for me was how powerful data can be when applied in the design process. Including quantitativev data into the design process allowed me to not have to make assumptions about the user. The qualitative feedback from user testing was also much more informative because I looked to the data from A/B tests first, and asked users to explain the same qualitatively.</p>
